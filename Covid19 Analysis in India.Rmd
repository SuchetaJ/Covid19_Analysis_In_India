#INTRODUCTION
----
----
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan,
China, has quickly spread to various countries, with many cases having been reported worldwide.
The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, 
among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.
The number of Coronairus cases have been increasing rapidly in India since then. The aim of
the project is to analyse the trends in Covid-19 cases in India from January,2020 to January,2021.
The project has two datasets, covid_19_india.csv and StatewiseTestingDetails.csv.

CONCLUSION

The first Covid 19 case was observed in January in Kerala. These numbers kept on
increasing and were maximum during the months May to July. Initially no tests were
being conducted, but later on the number of tests conducted increased sharply 
during the end of the year. Though there was a decrease in the number of Covid 
cases and Deaths towards the end. Most of the people suffering from Covid 
recovered as seen by the linear correlation between the two variables.
The number of Deaths initially increased sharply but later on started decreasing.

From the above plots we can conclude that Maharashtra observes the highest number
of Covid 19 Cases,deaths and recoveries followed by Karnataka in the year 2020.
Rest of the states though had high values but had numbers even less than 
Maharashtra. Maharashtra was also among one of those states which had the maximum 
number of positive results for the tests followed by Kerala.

We can conclude that with time as the number of tests increased the total number
Covid 19 cases kept decreasing. Also in Maharasthra there was a sharp fall in the
number of cases, though this didn't last long and further increased. All the 
States and Union Territories of India were badly affected during the middle of 
the year. States in the southern part of India were among the top States with 
maximum number of Covid19 cases. The north-eastern part of India was fairly protected
by the virus as can be seen with its low numbers.
